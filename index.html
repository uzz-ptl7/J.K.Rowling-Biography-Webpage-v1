        <p>J.K. Rowling at a book signing in
    2007, the year that the final book in
    the series, Harry Potter and the
    Deathly Hallows, was published.</p>
        <p>The first book in the Harry Potter series,
             Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone (1997; also published as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone),
             was released under the name J.K. Rowling.
              (Her publisher recommended a gender-neutral pen name; born Joanne Rowling, she used J.K., adding the middle name Kathleen.)
    The book was an immediate success, appealing to both
    children, who were its intended audience, and adults.</p>
        <p>Featuring vivid descriptions and an imaginative story line, it followed the adventures of the
    unlikely hero Harry Potter, a lonely orphan who discovers that he is actually a wizard and
    enrolls in the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The book received numerous
    awards, including the British Book Award. Succeeding volumes—Harry Potter and the
    Chamber of Secrets (1998), Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (1999), Harry Potter
    and the Goblet of Fire (2000), Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2003), and Harry
    Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2005)—also were best sellers, available in more than 200
    countries and some 60 languages. The seventh and final novel in the series, Harry Potter and
    the Deathly Hallows, was released in 2007.</p>
        <hr>

        <h2><li><u>HARRY POTTER ON THE BIG SCREEN AND ON STAGE</u></li></h2>
        <p>The Harry Potter series sparked great enthusiasm among children and was credited with
    generating a new interest in reading. Film versions of the books were released in 2001–11 and
    became some of the top-grossing movies in the world. In addition, Rowling wrote the
    companion volumes Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them (2001), which was adapted into
    a film series (2016, 2018) that featured screenplays by Rowling; Quidditch Through the Ages
    (2001); and The Tales of Beedle the Bard (2008)—all of which originated as books read by
    Harry Potter and his friends within the fictional world of the series. Proceeds from their sales
    were donated to charity.</p>
        <p>She later cowrote a story that became the basis for the play Harry Potter and the Cursed
    Child, which premiered in 2016 and was a critical and commercial success, winning an
    unprecedented nine Olivier Awards, including best new play. In the production, Harry is a
    husband and father but is still struggling with his past, while his son Albus must contend with
    his father’s legacy. A book version of the script, which was advertised as the eighth story in
    the Harry Potter series, was published in 2016. Two years later the play transferred to
    Broadway, and in 2018 it won six Tony Awards, including best new play.</p>

        <h2><li><u>WRITING FOR ADULTS</u></li></h2>
        <p>Rowling made her first foray into adult fiction with The Casual Vacancy (2012; TV
    miniseries 2015), a contemporary social satire set in a small English town. In 2013 it was
    revealed that the author had penned the crime novel The Cuckoo’s Calling, using the
    pseudonym Robert Galbraith. The Silkworm—the second book in the series, which centred on
    the detective Cormoran Strike, a down-on-his-luck war veteran—was released in 2014. </p>
        <p>Later installments included Career of Evil (2015), Lethal White (2018), Troubled Blood (2020), and
    The Ink Black Heart (2022). A television series based on the books premiered in the United
    Kingdom in 2017 and in the United States the following year. In May 2020, during the
    COVID-19 pandemic, Rowling began serializing a new children’s book, The Ickabog, for free
    online; it was published in November. She described the fairy tale, which was unrelated to
    Harry Potter, as an exploration of “truth and the abuse of power.” She later published The
    Christmas Pig (2021), about a boy who loses his favourite toy and then embarks on a
    fantastical quest to find it.</p>

        <h2><li><u>HONORS AND CONTROVERSY</u></li></h2>
        <p>Rowling was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2001. In 2009
    she was named a chevalier of the French Legion of Honour.</p>
        <p>However, in June 2020, Rowling drew unaccustomed criticism for taking exception on social
    media to an article that referenced “people who menstruate.” In part, Rowling tweeted
    “‘People who menstruate.’ I’m sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help
    me out.” Rowling’s comments were seen as being unsympathetic to or out of touch with the
    transgender community. Some of the actors in the Harry Potter series, including Daniel
    Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson publicly opposed the author, while others,
    including Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter, and Robbie Coltrane expressed support.</p>
